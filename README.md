# Using Regression Analysis to Determine Marketing ROI

A clothing retailer is considering an ad campaign for a Times Square takeover campaign. This is a big investment, but it's a competitive business, and the winners have to make big bets to build consumer perception that drives demand. It's our job to make sure those are safe bets as well.

Our client in this branded lifestyle space has made similar investments in the past and we have some really good data on hand to analyze, data that will help us to see what sort of response we have achieved using different channels, like broadcast media, out-of-home billboard, and more. Our job is to leverage that data to clarify the impact on those investments.
